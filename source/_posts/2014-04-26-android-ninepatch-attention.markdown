I have got many crash report data about using NinePath Drwable. I put a .9.png file into the drawable-xhdpi folder and the file did not exist in any other folder. And I got ResourceNotFoundException. I got this following sayings.
>A NinePatchDrawable graphic is a stretchable bitmap image, which Android will automatically resize to accommodate the contents of the View in which you have placed it as the background. An example use of a NinePatch is the backgrounds used by standard Android buttons â€” buttons must stretch to accommodate strings of various lengths. A NinePatch drawable is a standard PNG image that includes an extra 1-pixel-wide border. **It must be saved with the extension .9.png, and saved into the res/drawable/ directory of your project.**

The .9.png files must be saved into the res/drawable directory. Why? I guess the legacy Resouce Loading System implemententation may result in this issue. So at least put one .9.png file into the drawable folder.
