# Blogs Project - Claude Code Configuration

## Writing Style Guidelines

### 技术小黑屋写作风格
For all blog articles in this project, follow the writing style defined in:
**Reference**: `~/.claude/references/tech_blackhouse_style.md` (project-local: `.claude/references/tech_blackhouse_style.md`)

**Key Style Principles:**
- **口语化表达**: Natural, conversational tone like chatting with friends
- **问题导向**: Start from real-world problems, not just listing concepts
- **代码为王**: Provide runnable code examples with clear comments
- **原理挖掘**: Deep dive into underlying implementation and principles
- **循序渐进**: Progress from "what" → "why" → "how to use"

**Article Structure:**
1. Engaging title that highlights pain points or value
2. Opening: Introduce the problem with relatable scenarios
3. Body: Layered content with clear subheadings (##, ###)
4. Code blocks: Syntax highlighted with necessary comments
5. Closing: Summary and key takeaways

**Technical Depth:**
- Source code analysis with key implementation explanations
- Version/approach comparisons to highlight differences
- Best practices and real-world usage recommendations
- Share actual pitfalls and solutions encountered
